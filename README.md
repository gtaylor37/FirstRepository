FirstRepository
=============

My name is Glen Taylor and I am an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science. I've 2 years experience in programming and have experience in C++, Python, Java, Lisp, and Perl. This is my first repository, and I will be using it to try out version control, assist in open source projects, and improve my programming skills.
